# 👋 Hi, I'm Naijei Jiang

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a computer science student exploring web development, software engineering, and AI. I love building small, creative projects to learn by doing.

## 🔭 Projects

Here are a few projects I’ve worked on recently:

- [Password Generator](https://github.com/Naijei1/Password-Generator) — Generate secure passwords with custom length and copy-to-clipboard support.
- [Scoreboard](https://github.com/Naijei1/Scoreboard) — A responsive two-team scoreboard with basic JS logic.
- [Rochester Hometown Website](https://github.com/Naijei1/Rochester-Web) — A personal site built with HTML and CSS to showcase my hometown and learn web basics.
